		<h2>Description</h2>

		<p>Mega Man X is a robot designed by Dr. Light to choose his own path in life.
		<br>Years after he is created, Dr. Cain finds X and mimics his design to create a race of such robots called reploids.
		<br>When the sigma virus infects these reploids, causing them to commit acts of evil, it is up to Mega Man X and his partner Zero (who is quite powerful, contrary to what his name implies) to stop it.</p>

		<h2>Quote</h2>

		<blockquote><i>Mega Man X distinguishes itself as its own series by setting itself a hundred years in the future of the original Mega Man titles. Yes indeed, instead of the year 20XX, we find ourselves joining a brand new blue bomber in the year 21XX! Also, instead of playing as a robot child wearing his robo-undies outside his jumpsuit, we get to play as a robot teenager wearing his robo-undies outside his jumpsuit! How much more X-treme can you get?</i>
