			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="images/myphoto.JPG" alt="Picture of me" id="self">Nice to meet you! My name is Allen Ko, and I'm currently a sophomore in Game Design & Development student at RIT. In this class, I'm hoping to learn how to utilize things like HTML and CSS to be able to possibly create my own website in the future for <span class ="cross">extremely in-depth guides on how to play with pieces of cardboard</span> actually, I haven't thought that far, but I'm sure I'll have a use for it by then. Ideally by the time I've graduated I'll have landed a job as a game developer, though I'm not sure where, as I'm open to learning whatever I can, and as much as I'd like to try and develop an entire game by myself, I don't think that will be my goal straight out of college.

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			
			<p>
				My main interests are video games and anime (you know, the usual college kid stuff), basically anything that I find enjoyable that helps pass the time. I also play the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game, which I feel reflects my desire to play games that have a ridiculously high ceiling in terms of what you can do in them. I'm not really sure what my favorite music genres are; I've noticed that the kind of music I like generally isn't mainstream, but it's not like I explicitly dislike popular music either. I'm also currently part of the rabbit hole known as VTubers, which I highly recommend not looking too far into <span class="cross">unless you're into anime girls</span>.
