            <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
            <p id="abouttext">
                I've always been interested in video games, which has led to an interest in game balance and level design. I've played all types of games, and I think it's amazing the amount of balancing that goes into each one, as well as the way game balance is broken through certain bugs and exploits. My philosophy is that as long as the bug doesn't make th game outright unplayable, it's something that should be allowed, within reason, and it is this same philosophy that I hope to be able to include in my own work. In my spare time, I enjoy compiling information and strategies in the games that I play. In terms of programming ability, I mainly use C#, though I also have knowledge of Java and basic knowledge of Python.
